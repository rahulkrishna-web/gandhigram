            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>A 41-year-old female client approached us with intense emotional distress and suicidal thoughts stemming from severe marital conflict. Upon discovery of her husband's extramarital affair, the family faced instability, affecting her children deeply. The client suffered from sleep disturbances and severe anxiety, leading to frequent arguments and emotional outbursts.</p>

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>After just two sessions, she reported feeling calmer and more confident. Her improved emotional state allowed for more constructive communication within the family. Eventually, her husband began to rebuild their relationship, leading to significantly improved family dynamics.</p>
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>This case highlights the transformative power of timely professional counselling in resolving deep-seated family conflicts and restoring peace to the household.</p>
